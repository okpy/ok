"""DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS

This multi-line string contains instructions for developers. It is removed
when the client is distributed to students.

This file is responsible for all communication with the server and will contain
all protocols that are used in this project. Students should never need to
modify this file and staff should change the "protocols" list in the
configuration variables to include the protocols that they wish to use for the
project.


Contributors should do the following to add a protocol to this autograder:

    1- Extend the Protocol class and implement on_start and on_interact.
    2- Add the classname of your protocol to the "protocols" list.
    3- If your protocol needs command line arguments, change parse_input.

The only useful methods in the framework code are send_to_server and
receive_from_server, which should be invoked if you wish to send information to
the server or receive information from the server outside of the default times.
