ok.py
=====

The ok.py client script supports programming projects by running tests, tracking
progress, and assisting in debugging. The ok.py server performs and displays
analysis of student progress based on logging sent from the client script.

(Coming soon) Visit http://okpy.org to use our hosted service for your course.

The ok.py software was developed for CS 61A at UC Berkeley.
